mpire tutorial(1) -- Example on how to use MPIre
====================================================================

## DESCRIPTION

MPIre is an open source library that allows the user to replay any MPI rank
from MPI applications. It first saves communications for the desired rank at
capture run. Then it uses log files to simulate communications at replay run.

In this tutorial we will use MPIre to replay rank 0 for the Integer Sort (IS)
from the [NAS-MPI 3.3 benchmarks](http://www.nas.nasa.gov/).

## RANK 0 CAPTURE

Inside the IS directory build the application as you would normally do for A
class and 4 MPI ranks with

```bash
$ make CLASS=A NPROCS=4
```

Choose the rank you want to capture (i.e. rank 0)

```bash
$ export MPIRE_RANK=0
```

Then you have to run IS while MPIre captures the desired rank with libmpire_capture.
The best way to use MPIre is to load the library with LD_PRELOAD so it avoid
recompiling the application

```bash
$ LD_PRELOAD=/usr/local/lib/libmpire_capture.so mpirun -n 4 ./is.A.4
```

By default logs files are dumped in ".mpire/dumps/<rank>/log/".

## RANK 0 REPLAY

Now you can replay the rank 0

```bash
$ LD_PRELOAD=/usr/local/lib/libmpire_replay.so ./is.A.4
```

As you can see you don't need to run it with mpirun since it only executes
one process. Still, MPIre makes sure that the initial environment is restored. It
means that for instance, MPI_Comm_size will return the inital number of MPI ranks
when you captured the rank being replayed, here 4.

## OPTIONAL PARAMETERS

By default logs files are dumped in ".mpire/dumps/<rank>/log/". You can modify
this path with the following command

```bash
$ export MPIRE_OUTPUT_PATH="your/path"
```

Also, MPIre captures MPI communications since the start of the application. You
can modify this behaviour by setting the MPIRE_ACTIVE_DUMP variable to 0. MPIre
won't capture until you set it back to 1.

```bash
$ export MPIRE_ACTIVE_DUMP=0
```
